# Study Time Tracker

The **Study Time Tracker** is a simple Python program that helps users estimate how many hours they are likely to study in a week based on their daily study time. By entering the number of hours studied today, the program calculates a weekly estimate and displays it clearly. It also includes basic error handling to prevent invalid input from crashing the program.

This project demonstrates clean coding practices, user interaction through input(), basic numeric calculations, and a professional Git workflow using commits for each task.
